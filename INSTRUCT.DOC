1 - Summary Of Game
-------------------
  Jezebel is like your Queen, she is the person that your life will be based
around. She is a 1 trigabyte virus. Nobody will ever be worthy of her, but
your goal is to make her happy, by infecting the smaller computers that
she can't fit on. Your goal is to become a 1 gigabyte virus.



-----------------------
2 - Battle Instructions
-----------------------
  This is the heart of the game. You must engage in battle if you want to
please Jezebel. There are a few things to keep in mind when in Battle though.
If you are anywhere below the size of the program you are attacking, it's
a good idea to make like a farmer, and bail. While fighting, you might come
across Protoplasm pods. You want these, they come in handy in the sewers,
but be warned, some are infected. If you come across Samantha, it's a good
idea to help her out, because she is Jezebel's little sister. You might
also come acrossed Norton, who will, for a protoplasm pod, show you the
ancient art of Mutation. The more mutation you have, the higher the chances
are that when a program takes it's final blow against you, you'll mutate.
Which will completely revive you, so that you can whoop ass on the program.


-----------------------
3 - Attack Instructions
-----------------------
  This is alot like a battle, except your fighting the other people in the
game. There are some rules here, you need to have a battle left, so that you
will have enough energy to fight them. And you can't attack anyone below you,
only people above you. Again, if you have mutation, and they come at you, it
just might save you.


----------------------
4 - Sewer Instructions
----------------------
  The sewers, it's a place to rest, and relax. You can join a conversation
with other virii that have visitted recently. You can flirt with Jezebel
(if your male) or Brian (if your female). There are many things to do in
the sewer.


-------------------------
5 - Flirting Instructions
-------------------------
  You need to keep an eye on your charm for this one. Charm below 10, just
nod, and for each 10 more charm that you have, you can go up one. And don't
think flirting is useless, it will add to your bytes, so don't just blow
it off like it doesn't matter.


---------------------
6 - Attempting Growth
---------------------
  This is how you go up levels, and progress through the game. Each time you
attempt to go up a level, and are ready for it, Jezebel will ask you to
answer a riddle for her. You only get one chance per day, so if you guess
wrong, you'll be stuck on your level till tommorrow. There are 12 levels,
each level has a new mission. Be sure to read your mission each time.

7 - How to use Color
--------------------
  Jezebel supports two types of color. You can use LORD style colors, or you
can use Renegade's PIPE color system. Either one will work.
 First, Renegade's colors....
You take a pipe, | (it's that thing above your \ key) and a number between
01 and 15, MAKE SURE it's 2 digits, not |1, it has to be |01.. ;)
01 is Blue 02 is green 03 is cyan 04 is red 05 is magenta 06 is brown
07 is grey 08 lt black 09 lt blue 10 lt green 11 lt cyan 12 lt red
13 lt magenta 14 yellow 15 white
|03This would be Cyan
Try it out in the conversation room. ;)
Now for the LORD color codes.
You take a ` (it's at the top left of your keyboard) and one of these
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 ! @ # $ %
1 Blue 2 Green 3 Cyan 4 Red 5 Magenta 6 Brown 7 Grey 8 Lt Black 9 Lt Blue
0 Lt Green ! Lt Cyan @ Lt Red # Lt Magenta % White
`#This would be a pinkish color :)
Go out and try the color codes in the conversation room. Or put them
in your Virus Name!
